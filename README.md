# PngGenerator
PngGenerator as included in [IMaRS_spa ](https://github.com/USF-IMARS/imars_spa)

I've read through to be sure there was no sensitive information, but TBH I don't know much about this. I believe it is a development source for the script included in imars_spa, though it is probably out of date. I believe it is used to cut png images out of HDF / H5 files.

It may not be worth tracking this separately from imars_spa, but since I am not sure I will retain it here for now.
